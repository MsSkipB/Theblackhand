	<p>Once there was a family: Father, mother and a daughter. Together they lived in a flat on the 5th floor. One evening the parents decided to have some time alone and left the girl alone at the flat. The girl was told that after she has had her dinner she shall brush her teeth and go to sleep. Also she was told that it was realy important, that she would lock the doors! The girl just nodded her head and was happy she will finaly be able to spend time alone at home. She felt like a grown up - her parents were trusting her enough and weren't afraid to leave her at home by herself. Just as they agreed, the girl, after some time, sat down to eat her dinner.To avoid being bored she decided to turn on the tv, Suddenly, the programm she was watching was interupted by an important announcement:
	<br>
	<em>-Girl, Girl! Lock your doors! The black hand is already next to your house!</em>,- The news reporter said, looking deeply into the eyes of the girl.
	<br>
	The girl didn't mind the newsreport and changed the chanel. Again, unexpectedly her program was interrupted by an important announcement:
	<br>
	<em>-Girl, Girl! Lock your doors! The black hand is already on the first floor!</em>,- said the newsreporter with fear in her eyes.
	<br>
	The girl still didn't bother to pay attention to what was being said. This way the newspreporter tried to talk her into locking her doors three more times in wain. Finaly, the girl decided to lift herself of the sofa and lock those god damn doors, She grabed the keys that were laying on the table and went into the coridor. As she went closer to the doors she realised, that the doors weren't just unlocked, they were also cracked open! As soon as she realised that she felt a hit on her back.
	<br>
	After some time the parents finaly came back home. They climed up to the fifth floor and found their flat doors wide opened. The corridor smelled like fresly fried meat patties</p>
